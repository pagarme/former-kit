> Theming-first components so you can focus on design, not implementation.

FormerKit can be mostly compared to other UI libraries out there, but not
exactly. The philosophy behind FormerKit is to build a white-label React
component library by decoupling styles from component's HTML structure,
allowing highly customizable user interfaces without the hurdle to build
everytime the same HTML structure and React component interface
abstractions.

**The fastest way to get started with former kit is using our [Starter Dashboard](https://github.com/pagarme/react-scripts-former-kit-dashboard).**

## Using

Install `former-kit`. If you want to see the full power of FormerKit, you
will also need a skin. We have developed a skin based on our styleguide,
it's available in package
[npm former-kit-skin-pagarme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/former-kit-skin-pagarme)
or in the github repository
[former-kit-skin-pagarme](https://github.com/pagarme/former-kit-skin-pagarme)

```sh
yarn add former-kit former-kit-skin-pagarme
```

Check the [full documentation][docs] to understand how to use components.
